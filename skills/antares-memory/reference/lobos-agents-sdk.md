# The internal pack — antares' 5 lobos (Agent SDK)

Antares' judgment points run as **isolated subagents** ("lobos"), not as a bare
`claude -p`. The old `claude -p` extractor loaded your `CLAUDE.md` + persona files
into every run → extraction biased by the operator's voice and inflated token use.
The lobos run with `settingSources: []`, so they see **only** the task you hand
them — no CLAUDE.md, no persona, no auto-memory.

Three lobos run headless through the Claude Agent SDK (extractor, gardener, curator);
two (router, recall) are filesystem subagents the parent dispatches in-session.

## Prerequisite — bring the SDK (one command)

The headless lobos need `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`. It is **not vendored**
(`node_modules/` is gitignored) — the skill ships the config, you bring the SDK:

```bash
cd "$(dirname "$(command -v claude)")"   # or wherever the plugin cache lives
# In practice: cd into the installed plugin's agents-sdk/ dir, then:
npm ci             # clean, reproducible install from package-lock.json
```

The plugin ships `agents-sdk/package.json` + `package-lock.json`; `npm ci` there is the whole setup (`npm install` also works).
Verify: `node -e "import('@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk').then(()=>console.log('SDK ok'))"`.

- **Auth** — uses your Claude subscription login (`apiKeySource=none`). Do **not**
  set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; it wins and bills the API. For unattended machines,
  `claude setup-token` → export `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`.
- **Node gotcha** — every `.mjs` passes `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable: "claude"`; the
  bundled binary fails to launch on node ≥24.
- **stdin** — lobos read their task via async stream iteration, not `readFileSync(0)`
  (which throws `EAGAIN` when fd0 is non-blocking under `printf | node`).

## The pack

| Lobo | Runtime | Trigger | Access | Job |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **extractor** | SDK headless | PreCompact | reads the dying transcript | distill what mattered into memories — isolated, no persona bias (replaces the old `claude -p`) |
| **router** | filesystem agent | dispatched on "save this" / "guarda esto" | reads + writes memories | pick scope (home / project / both / persona) and **dedup semantically** before writing |
| **recall** | filesystem agent | parent dispatches on history questions ("¿ya tratamos X?", "¿qué decidimos?") | read-only (Read/Grep/Glob) | episodic recall — synthesizes what happened / when / decided from memories + journals (on-demand, not the hot path) |
| **gardener** | SDK headless (**opus**) | SessionEnd, gate ≥24h | digest-triage → merges survivors (Edit) → lists redundant files; launcher backs up + deletes | periodic base hygiene: **acts** — consolidates near-dups, removes obsolete (folds unique content into the survivor first); leaves no notes to review |
| **index-curator** | SDK headless (**opus**) | SessionEnd, gate ≥7d | reads digest + its prefs memory, **edits `MEMORY.md`** | OWNS the always-on index: decides + applies promotions/demotions, keeps a persistent operator-preferences memory, backs up `MEMORY.md` first, writes a changelog. Conservative on removal |

Every headless lobo: `settingSources: []` (isolation), `bypassPermissions`, a capped
`maxTurns`, and a fire-and-forget launcher with a frequency **gate** + **lock** so it
never blocks session close nor runs twice at once.

## Scaling: IO in bash, judgment in the LLM

A base with 150+ memories will **time out** a lobo that Reads every body (observed:
the gardener at rc=124 / 300s). So both maintenance launchers (gardener and curator)
pre-digest: bash builds `filename: description` (frontmatter only) for every memory and
passes it **inline** in the task prompt. The lobo triages from text in a few turns and
reads only the handful of files a real candidate needs — no base sweep. Same split as
the extractor: the agent judges, the shell does the IO. When you add a maintenance lobo
over the whole base, digest first; don't make the model read 150 files.

The curator additionally **owns** `MEMORY.md`: the operator delegated index curation, so
it edits the index directly. Two guardrails make that safe — the launcher backs up
`MEMORY.md` before every run (last 10 kept under `$ANTARES_STATE/memory-md-backups/`),
and the curator reads/writes a persistent preferences memory
(`$ANTARES_STATE/curator-memory.md`) so its taste stays consistent across runs, leaving
a changelog (`.index-changelog.md`) of every change for the operator to audit.

The gardener likewise **acts** instead of annotating — it merges duplicates and removes
obsolete memories. Same delegation, stronger guardrails: the launcher takes a FULL tar
backup of the base before each run (`$ANTARES_STATE/base-backups/`, last 5), the lobo
**never deletes** (it Edits survivors and Writes a deletions list that the launcher
validates + executes — only `.md` inside the memory dir, never `MEMORY.md`), it folds
unique content into the survivor *before* listing a file, and it keeps its own
preferences memory + `.gardener-changelog.md`. The one rule it honors above all: never
lose an important memory — when unsure, KEEP.

## Knobs (env vars — no script edits, survive plugin updates)

`ANTARES_PRECOMPACT_MODEL` / `_TIMEOUT` (extractor) · `ANTARES_GARDENER_MODEL` /
`_EFFORT` / `_TIMEOUT` · `ANTARES_CURATOR_MODEL` / `_EFFORT` / `_TIMEOUT` ·
`ANTARES_RECALL_MODEL` / `_EFFORT`. Defaults: model `sonnet`, effort `medium` — except
the **curator**, which defaults to **opus / high** (it owns the index; the operator wants
its best judgment on what stays always-on).

## The one rule when adding a lobo

**Never cascade headless calls.** A headless run that can spawn another headless run
is a fork bomb (the 2026-04-01 incident: 101 sessions / 723 containers in 74 minutes).
Four defenses, always: `settingSources: []`, **no** Agent tool in `allowedTools`,
`CLAUDE_HEADLESS=1` exported, and a capped budget / `maxTurns`. The launchers' gate +
lock are the outer ring of the same defense.
